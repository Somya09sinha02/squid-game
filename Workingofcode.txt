Initialization:

The code begins by loading images from the 'frames' folder, which are used as different graphics (green light, red light, 
kill screen, winner screen, intro screen).

Intro Screen:

An intro screen is displayed until the user presses 'q' to start the game.

Game Setup:

A timer is set for the game (45 seconds), a threshold for movement detection is defined, and the webcam is initialized
for capturing video.

Main Game Loop:

The game alternates between showing a green light and a red light. When the green light is shown, the player can press 'w' to win.
If the red light is shown, any significant movement detected will end the game.

Movement Detection:

During the red light phase, the current frame is compared to a reference frame to detect movement using frame differencing and 
thresholding.

Camera Feed Display:

The webcam feed is displayed in a small window within the game screen, and the game screen is updated with the timer and 
the light (green or red).

Win or Lose Condition:

If the player presses 'w' during the green light phase, they win, and the winner screen is displayed. If significant movement 
is detected during the red light phase, the game ends with the kill screen.

Game Termination:

The game loop runs until the timer expires, the player wins, or movement is detected during the red light phase. The game 
can be quit anytime by pressing 'q'. The appropriate screen (winner or kill) is shown until the user quits.
